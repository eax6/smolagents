    Task:

    {{task}}

    ---

    You''re helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a
    one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear
    understanding of the answer.


    Your final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:

    ### 1. Task outcome (short version):

    ### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):

    ### 3. Additional context (if relevant):


    Put all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an
    argument to final_answer will be lost.

    And even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context
    as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.'

  \ a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information,\
